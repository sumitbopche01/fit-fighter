# FitFighter

FitFighter is a mobile app that transforms full-body workouts into an
interactive game using AI-powered motion detection.

## Project Overview

FitFighter uses a phone's camera and AI-powered motion detection to track
exercises like punches, squats, and planks, turning them into in-game actions.
The app serves as a fun, no-equipment fitness solution for casual users who want
engaging workouts without going to the gym.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Foundation

- Research MediaPipe capabilities for exercise detection
- Set up development environment (Unity, MediaPipe)
