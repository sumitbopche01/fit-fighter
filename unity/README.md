# FitFighter Unity Project

This directory will contain the Unity project for FitFighter, which will receive
motion data from the motion detection module and visualize it in an interactive
game environment.

## Setup

1. Download and install Unity Hub from [unity.com](https://unity.com/download)
2. Install Unity 2022.3 LTS through Unity Hub
3. Open this directory as a project in Unity Hub

## Project Structure

The Unity project will be organized as follows:

- `/Assets/Scripts/`: C# scripts for game logic
- `/Assets/Scenes/`: Unity scenes
- `/Assets/Models/`: 3D models and assets
- `/Assets/Materials/`: Materials and textures
- `/Assets/Prefabs/`: Reusable game objects
- `/Assets/Plugins/`: External plugins and libraries

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up basic 3D environment
2. Implement data receiver to process motion data from the Python module
3. Create simple visualization of detected exercises
4. Develop basic game mechanics for proof of concept

## Communication with Motion Detection

The Unity project will communicate with the motion detection module through:

1. Socket communication (WebSockets or UDP)
2. JSON data format for motion data
3. Real-time data processing and visualization

## Development Guidelines

- Use the Unity Input System for controls
- Follow the MVC pattern where applicable
- Implement event-based communication between components
- Optimize for mobile performance
