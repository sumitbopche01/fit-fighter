# Proof of Concept Implementation

This document outlines the approach for building the initial proof of concept
for FitFighter.

## Objectives

1. Demonstrate basic camera input processing
2. Implement preliminary motion detection for at least one exercise
3. Create a simple visualization system
4. Evaluate performance and accuracy
5. Identify technical challenges

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Basic Camera Input Processing

- Set up webcam/camera input stream
- Process frames in real-time
- Implement basic image preprocessing (resize, color conversion)
- Display processed output

### 2. MediaPipe Integration

- Implement MediaPipe Pose detection
- Extract and visualize key points
- Process and analyze pose data
- Implement basic exercise detection logic

### 3. Simple Visualization System

- Display skeleton overlay on camera feed
- Visualize detection status and confidence
- Implement basic UI elements for debugging
- Create performance metrics display

### 4. Performance Evaluation

- Measure and log frame processing time
- Calculate detection accuracy
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Document hardware performance differences

## Proof of Concept Deliverables

1. Working code demonstrating:
   - Camera input processing
   - Pose detection
   - Basic exercise recognition

2. Documentation including:
   - Setup instructions
   - Performance metrics
   - Known limitations
   - Recommendations for full implementation

3. Technical evaluation report detailing:
   - Feasibility assessment
   - Performance benchmarks
