# MediaPipe Research and Implementation

This document outlines the research approach for implementing motion detection
with MediaPipe for FitFighter.

## Research Goals

1. Determine the feasibility of detecting three key exercises:
   - Punches (various types)
   - Squats
   - Planks

2. Assess the accuracy and real-time performance on mobile devices
3. Identify limitations and potential workarounds
4. Establish performance benchmarks for different device capabilities

## MediaPipe Components to Explore

### Pose Detection

- [MediaPipe Pose](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html) for
  skeletal tracking
- Assessment of detection accuracy for our specific exercises
- Performance evaluation on different devices

### Hand Tracking

- [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) for
  precise punch detection
- Evaluation of combined pose + hand tracking performance impact

## Exercise Detection Approach

### Punch Detection

Potential approaches:

- Track wrist velocity and acceleration
- Measure distance change between shoulder and wrist
- Identify characteristic motion patterns
- Consider directional detection (straight, hooks, uppercuts)

### Squat Detection

Potential approaches:

- Track hip height relative to knees
- Measure angle between hip, knee, and ankle
- Detect characteristic up/down motion pattern

### Plank Detection

Potential approaches:

- Measure body alignment (shoulders, hips, ankles)
- Track stability of position over time
- Detect characteristic pose angles

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with individual proof-of-concept for each exercise
2. Benchmark performance and accuracy
3. Refine detection algorithms
4. Implement combined detection system
5. Optimize for mobile performance

## Metrics to Track

- Detection accuracy (true positives, false positives, false negatives)
- Processing time per frame
- CPU/GPU usage
- Battery impact

## Research Questions

- What is the minimum hardware specification needed for acceptable performance?
- Can we achieve 30+ FPS with motion detection on mid-range devices?
- What strategies can we employ to optimize performance?
- How do different lighting conditions affect detection accuracy?
- What camera positioning works best for full-body detection?
